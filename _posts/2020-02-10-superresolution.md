# Superresolution

These are some fascinating results from the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/) "Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3". In [lesson 7](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=7) of the 2019 course one of the topics was about so-called "superresolution", i.e. how to improve! the resolution of low-res images with deep learning.

First of all, the improvement in resolution is quite astonishing - but also have take a look at the texture of the tree, which was made furry-ish by the neural network.
