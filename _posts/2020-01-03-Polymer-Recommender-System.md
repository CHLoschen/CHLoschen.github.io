# Using a recommender system for ill-defined chemical systems

This [jupyter notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LjgU62N9bY_E0OhgFLW-T41JbOLbx708/view?usp=sharing) contains some commented code
showing how based on a matrix of experimental data (e.g. solvent / polymer solubilities) one can develop a predictive model without the need
to use any descriptors. The method is called collaborative filtering via matrix factorization and heavily used to predict user - item ratings.
